I watched youtube until about 10:30 am where I started to get to work but frankly procrastinated. The day was turned around when i made a good plan for what my dorm room needs. In between that and shopping for mom I hosted a meeting for Ross. It went wonderfully as I asserted myself and made sure everything was taken care of. Shopping with mom was meaningful but difficult because I didn't want to buy anything. She drove us over to Moldoon's where I got 3 pairs of fancy pants (ooh).

Prior to going shopping Aislyn and I discussed how we want our relationship to function while in Madison. It caused conflict that bubbled up after I dropped her off and admitted that my decision to call was to make her feel like I care about here which understandably didn't go well.
